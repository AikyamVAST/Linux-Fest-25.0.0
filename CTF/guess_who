**"A Wild Goose in the Wrong Directory"**

You searched the depths of the file, turned it inside out, base64-decoded it, hex-dumped it, and even ran `strings` like a digital exorcist. You stared into its binary soul and found... nothing but the echo of your own confusion.

It’s not in the content.
It’s not in the filename.
It’s not in the metadata, the permissions, or the timestamp from 1970.

You’re barking up the wrong inode, my friend.

The flag isn’t hiding in the bytes — it’s laughing at you from above. Or rather... from ownership. Yes, that mysterious land of `chown` and `ls -l`, where names hold secrets and files wear badges.

Stop reading the file.
Start reading who owns it.
